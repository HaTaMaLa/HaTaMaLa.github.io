        <p class="hoca">This was the day where i got my first phone ever. It was a Samsung galaxy S3 mini.<br> I got this new phone because i learned to read the Quran. The imam learned me everything, the alphabet and pronounciation. I am really thankfull for my teacher. But after 5 years his contract was over in Belgium and he went back to <strong>Turkey</strong></p>
        
        <h2 id="school">My school carier</h2>
        <p class="school"> My school carier was not the best but not bad either.<br>I studied Modern Sience untill <strong>5th grade</strong>. But unfortunatly i didn't get good grades this year so i decided to go to <em><strong>TSO</strong></em>. This was not a bad decision however, because i chose ICT and i love everything that has to do whith <strong>ICT</strong>. </p>
